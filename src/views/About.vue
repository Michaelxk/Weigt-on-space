    <h1>YOUR WEIGHT ON OTHER PLANETS</h1>
    <div class="container">
      <p>Your weight on other planets is a result of your mass, the strength of gravity on
        the planet and the distance you are from the centre of it.
       Your mass doesn't change on other planets, but the gravity and size of those
       planets affects how much you weight.
       This is why astronauts are able to jump so high on the Moon.</p>
      <p>Take a look at your weight on other planets to learn more about how gravity
        works and be amazed at how much, or how little, you weigh on other worlds.</p>
